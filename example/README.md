# go-basic-i18n Example

This example demonstrates how to use the `go-basic-i18n` library to implement basic internationalization (i18n) support in a Go application. It shows how to initialize the i18n system, retrieve localized messages based on the user's language preference, and display these messages in a simple console application.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Go installed on your system. This example requires Go version 1.21.5 or later.

## Getting Started

To run this example, follow these steps:

1. Clone the `go-basic-i18n` repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `example` directory within the cloned repository.
3. Run `go build` to compile the example program.
4. Execute the compiled binary.

### Running the Example

After building the example, execute the binary. The program will initialize the i18n system, attempt to retrieve localized messages for English ("en"), and print out the messages for "signup.title" and "signup.button".
